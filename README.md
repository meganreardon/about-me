Code Fellows 201, Week 1 Class Project

May 15th 2016: This is a silly page made as a first week project at Code Fellows. I focused more on getting good syntax going in my basic JavaScript than design. Forgive the pile of alerts and prompts, they are what the assignment called for. I promise to never use them again.
